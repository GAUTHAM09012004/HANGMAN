# HANGMAN
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to discover a hidden word by guessing individual letters. The game begins with a blank line representing each letter of the word, and players take turns guessing letters. If a guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in its corresponding position(s) within the word.
