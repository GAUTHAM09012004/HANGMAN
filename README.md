Hangman is a classic word guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. This project aims to provide a digital version of the game that is user-friendly and suitable for all ages. The program utilizes the random module for word selection, sys module for system-specific functionality, time module for timing features, re module for pattern matching, and the pygame module for graphics and sound.
